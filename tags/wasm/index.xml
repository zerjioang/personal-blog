Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.
The official documentation of WASM can be found at https://webassembly.org/
How fast WASM is? The Wasm stack machine is designed to be encoded in a size- and load-time-efficient binary format. WebAssembly aims to execute at native speed by taking advantage of common hardware capabilities available on a wide range of platforms.</description></item></channel></rss>
